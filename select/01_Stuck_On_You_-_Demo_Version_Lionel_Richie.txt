Stuck on you, I've got this feeling down deep in my soul
That I just can't loose, guess I'm on my way!
Needed a friend and the way I feel
Now I guess I'll be with you till the end, guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed, mighty glad you stayed

Let me say: o, o, o, lets go!
Party!

Stuck on you, I've got this feeling down deep in my soul
That I just can't loose, guess I'm on my way!
Needed a friend and the way I feel
Now I guess I'll be with you till the end, guessi'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed, mighty glad you stayed.

I'll take it to the left if you take it to the right
I can dance all night with all my might!

O, o, o, o, o, o,
O, o, o, lets go!

Dancing it...
